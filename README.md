# Multimodal-Post-Recovery-Tracking-Model (M-PRTM)

This repository contains the implementation of a **Multimodal Post-Recovery Tracking Model (M-PRTM)** aimed at predicting heart failure (HF) prognosis and detecting myocardial fibrosis using a combination of **textual**, **numerical**, and **cinematic (Cardiac MRI)** data. The model integrates multimodal data sources to offer a more accurate and holistic evaluation of patient outcomes compared to traditional single-modality models.

## Introduction
Heart failure (HF) is a complex disease that requires careful monitoring and treatment to improve patient outcomes. The current clinical practice often uses single-modality data such as clinical measurements or imaging, but these approaches may be insufficient for accurate prediction. This project introduces a **Multimodal Post-Recovery Tracking Model (M-PRTM)**, which combines textual (medical prescriptions), numerical (clinical metrics), and cinematic (Cardiac MRI) data to improve the prediction accuracy of heart failure prognosis.

## Model Overview

The **Multimodal Post-Recovery Tracking Model (M-PRTM)** integrates three data modalities:

- **Cinematic Data**: Processed Cardiac MRI images used for myocardial fibrosis detection.
- **Numerical Data**: Clinical indicators, such as age, gender, blood pressure, and other key metrics.
- **Textual Data**: Medical records, including prescriptions and treatment history.

These modalities are processed through different specialized models:

- Cinematic data is processed using the DAE-Former model.
- Numerical data is processed via a fully connected neural network.
- Textual data is processed using a pre-trained BERT model.

The features from these modalities are fused using an attention mechanism to dynamically prioritize the most critical information for predictions.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexSun111111/Multimodal-Post-Recovery-Tracking-Model.git
cd Multimodal-Post-Recovery-Tracking-Model
```

### Example Code for Model Training
```python
import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel, BertConfig
from torch import nn

# Define model and tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Example data: Textual and Numerical inputs
texts = ['This is an example text for heart failure patient data']
numerical_data = torch.randn(1, 10)  # Random numerical features (e.g., age, weight, etc.)

# Tokenize textual data
inputs = tokenizer(texts, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512)

# Pass through the model
outputs = model(**inputs)
text_features = outputs.last_hidden_state

# Combine with numerical features
combined_features = torch.cat((text_features[:, 0, :], numerical_data), dim=1)

# Forward pass through the final layers
output = nn.Linear(768 + 10, 1)(combined_features)  # Assuming binary output for simplicity
```

### Model Evaluation
During training, the model's performance is evaluated on a validation set, and accuracy is measured for each task (binary classification, multiclass classification, and days prediction).
